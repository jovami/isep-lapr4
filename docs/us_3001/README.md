# Communication Infrastructure for Shared Boards Deployment

## Overview

----------------
This README provides a theoretical overview of the communication infrastructure required for deploying the Shared Boards solution. 
The goal is to establish a client-server architecture where the client application can access shared boards via a server. 
The communication between these components must adhere to a specific application protocol defined in a document 
from the computer network domain. Additionally, the client application should not directly access the relational 
database but only interact with the server application. The deployment of the solution is recommended to utilize 
multiple network nodes, with the relational database server and shared board server preferably deployed in the cloud.

## Functional Requirements

----------------
1. Client-Server Architecture: The solution must follow a client-server architecture. 
The client application will serve as the user interface for accessing the shared boards, 
while the server application will handle the underlying business logic and data management.

2. Application Protocol: The communication between the client application and the server 
application must adhere to a specific application protocol. Refer to the relevant document 
from the computer network domain to understand the details of this protocol.

3. Restricted Database Access: The client application should not directly access the 
relational database. Instead, it should interact solely with the server application, 
which will handle all database operations on behalf of the client.

## Deployment Recommendations

----------------
1. Network Nodes: Deploy the solution using multiple network nodes to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, 
and separation of concerns. Consider the following nodes:
    - Client Nodes: These nodes will host the client application and provide the user interface for 
   accessing shared boards. They can be desktops, laptops, or mobile devices used by end-users.
    - Server Nodes: These nodes will host the server application and handle the business logic 
   and data management. It is advisable to deploy the server nodes in a cloud environment to 
   leverage the benefits of scalability, availability, and managed services.
    - Database Nodes: The relational database server should be deployed on separate nodes from 
   the server application. It is recommended to deploy the database server in the cloud or on 
   dedicated hardware for better performance and scalability.

2. Cloud Deployment: Consider deploying the solution in the cloud, such as using infrastructure-as-a-service 
(IaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) providers. This allows for easy scalability, automated management, and high availability. Popular cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

3. Security Considerations: Ensure appropriate security measures are implemented to protect the communication 
infrastructure, including encryption, secure network protocols, access controls, and regular security updates. 
Consult with security experts to assess and implement the necessary security measures for your specific deployment scenario.

4. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation, including installation guides, configuration instructions, 
and troubleshooting steps, to assist with the setup, configuration, and maintenance of the communication infrastructure. 
This documentation should be easily accessible to the team members responsible for deploying and managing the solution.

## Conclusion

----------------
The communication infrastructure for deploying the Shared Boards solution requires a client-server architecture, 
adhering to a specific application protocol. The client application should not directly access the relational 
database but interact with the server application. Deploying the solution using multiple network nodes, 
including cloud-based deployment for scalability and separation of concerns, is recommended. 
Ensure the implementation of appropriate security measures and provide comprehensive documentation 
to facilitate the setup and maintenance of the infrastructure.
