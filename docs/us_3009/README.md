# US 3009

## 1. Context

**I want to view the History of a Board**

## 2. Requirements

*The main objective of this user story is to View the history updates of a board that a user is part of*

In order to view the history of a board first, there should be something in there.
The operations recorded in the history of a board are the following:
- US_3006 - Create a Post-it
- US_3007 - Edit/Change a Post-it
- US_3008 - Undo last Post-it Change


Every user should be able to see the updated Board History


## 3. Analysis

- Each new functionality should extend the main class board history, this class will be responsible 
for keeping one record of each operation performed in a board.
- The Board History should be presented in a chronological order, meaning the earliest operation performed in a board
should be the last one presented to the user(from the newest to the oldest).

  

## 4. Design

- To better answer this problem, we used the DTO pattern, meaning we created a class that will be responsible for
parsing the information of the board history, this class will be called **BoardHistoryDTO**.

- For easier scalability, we developed the Abstract class BoardHistory that will be extended by the following classes:
    + **CreatePostIt**
    + **ChangePostIt**
    + **UndoPostIt**

- Further classes that will be created in the future.

- The changes will be only saved on memory

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

- **DTO** - Data Transfer Object
  + **BoardHistoryDTO** - This class will be responsible for parsing the information of the board history.
- **State** - The state pattern was used to encapsulate the behavior associated with each state.
  + **BoardState**
- **Command Pattern** - BoardHistory Abstract class that will be extended by the following classes and is used to encapsulate a request as an object:
  + **CreatePostIt**
  + **ChangePostIt**
  + **UndoPostIt**
  
- **Repository** - Provides a way to retrieve and persist aggregates.
    + **BoardRepository**


### 4.4. Tests

In order to accurately test this functionality, we need to interact with the Aggregate Root repositories, meaning unit tests aren't the best approach here.

Instead, integration tests should be performed.

## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team will present, important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like the database operations*

 **JpaBaseRepository**
    
    public Optional<T> ofIdentity(final I id) {
        return this.matchOne("e." + this.identityFieldName() + " = :id", "id", id);
    }




## 6. Integration/Demonstration

* A new option on the client App menu options was added.

## 7. Observations

Nothing to add here.
